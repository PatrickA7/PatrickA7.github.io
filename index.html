        <h2>What is a Living Style Guide?</h2>
        
        <p>https://teamgaslight.com/blog/what-is-a-living-style-guideA living style guide is used by a team of developers and designers to understand how the application they are creating will look and feel.  This can include colour palettes, patterns, and typography. Developers and designers reference living style guides when developing their projects.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is a living style guide useful to developers and designers?</h2>
        
        <p>A team of developers and designers may have different ideas of how an application should be created. A living style guide acts as a reference point for the team so the application feels consistent in its creation. This allows a team to remain in sync during development.</p>
